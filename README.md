# AI Forester

## The Intersection of Forestry Expertise and Artificial Intelligence

AI Forester explores practical applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning in forestry, watershed management, and environmental science. This repository contains field tools, applications, and resources for forestry professionals interested in leveraging AI to enhance their work.

## About This Project

This project documents my journey of exploration at the intersection of traditional forestry expertise and emerging AI capabilities. As the field of environmental science increasingly adopts digital technologies, AI Forester aims to bridge the gap between established forestry practices and cutting-edge artificial intelligence.

## Featured Projects

### Culvert Sizing Application

A mobile-friendly application for sizing culverts in coastal British Columbia watersheds. The tool incorporates hydrology factors, terrain analysis, and climate considerations to recommend appropriate culvert sizes for forestry roads.

### Tree Health Assessment

Computer vision application that analyzes field photos to assess tree health conditions, identify potential diseases, and recommend management approaches.

## Getting Started

Each project directory contains specific instructions for installation and use. Most applications are designed to be accessible to forestry professionals without requiring extensive technical knowledge.
